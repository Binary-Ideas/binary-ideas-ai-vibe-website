## Winning Contracts Requires Precision

Proposal windows are tight and compliance stakes are high. Our AI stack helps you track opportunities, assemble bids, and manage delivery without missing deadlines or regulatory clauses.

## Agents for Every Phase

- **Capture Radar** - Monitors SAM.gov, eVA, and industry portals, prioritizing opportunities that match your NAICS codes.
- **Proposal Composer** - Drafts compliant sections, pulls past performance data, and assembles pricing tables.
- **Delivery Command Center** - Manages milestones, staffing, and reporting once the contract is yours.

## Keep Security Tight

1. **Access Controls** - Multi-factor authentication and data segmentation prevent unauthorized access.
2. **Audit Trails** - Immutable logs make DCAA and agency audits painless.
3. **Continuous Updates** - Agents push policy changes to project teams so compliance never lags.

> Government contracting success comes from process discipline; AI simply makes that discipline scalable.
