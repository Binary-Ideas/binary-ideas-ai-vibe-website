Conversational AI lets customers message software that responds like a human. Unlike “press 1 for hours” bots, these platforms learn, adapt, and handle complex requests. Owners love them because they’re:

- **Always on:** AI doesn’t clock out at 5 p.m.
- **Lower cost:** No need to hire staff just to repeat “We open at 9.”
- **Highly scalable:** Handle 10 or 1,000 chats without breaking.
- **Personalized:** The more it talks, the better it knows your business.
