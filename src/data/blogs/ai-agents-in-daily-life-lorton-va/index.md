- **Send friendly nudges** before you're late—like "leave now if you don't want to get stuck on I-95 traffic."
- **Spot conflicts automatically** and suggest rescheduling options that work for everyone.

Imagine you're enjoying a walk at **Occoquan Regional Park** and your phone buzzes—not with a random ad, but with a helpful AI alert.
