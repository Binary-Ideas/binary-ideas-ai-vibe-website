## Field Teams Need Real-Time Support

Traffic, weather, and last-minute calls make Virginia routes unpredictable. AI dispatchers adjust schedules on the fly, notify customers, and prep techs with everything they need before knocking on the door.

## Automations Inside the Hub

- **Predictive Routing** - Weather and traffic feeds reroute techs before delays happen.
- **Parts Intelligence** - Inventory bots verify truck stock and order replacements automatically.
- **Service Narratives** - Voice-to-text converts technician notes into polished summaries for the customer and CRM.

## Keep Feedback Loops Tight

1. **Customer Pulse Surveys** - Text surveys trigger five minutes after a visit.
2. **Escalation Radar** - Negative sentiment alerts managers instantly.
3. **Technician Coaching** - Performance dashboards surface training opportunities and celebrate wins.

> The result: happier crews, informed customers, and service margins that finally scale.
