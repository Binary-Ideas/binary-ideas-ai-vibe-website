## Design AI Around the Customer Journey

We map every milestone from welcome email to renewal call. Each step gets a lightweight AI helper: onboarding checklists, health-score alerts, and advocacy prompts. Agents log every interaction to your CRM so success managers stay informed and free to focus on strategic conversations.

## Automations That Retain Accounts

1. **Kickoff Concierge** - An agent schedules the kickoff, collects assets, and introduces your success manager.
2. **Adoption Coach** - Monitors product usage, serves in-app tips, and flags drop-offs to Slack.
3. **Renewal Scout** - Drafts QBR decks, compiles ROI data, and surfaces expansion opportunities.

## Keep Humans in Control

- **Outcome Dashboards** - Every AI action syncs to a live success scorecard.
- **Approval Gates** - Agents request human approval before sending sensitive outreach.
- **Voice of Customer Library** - Transcribed calls feed an insights board so leadership sees emerging themes.

> With the Binary Ideas stack, customer success stays personal while your AI agents handle the procedural heavy lifting.
