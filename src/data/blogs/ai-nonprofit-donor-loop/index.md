## Nonprofit Teams Are Stretched Thin

Staff juggle campaigns, events, and reporting. AI donor loops give them breathing room by handling personalized outreach, scheduling meetings, and tracking stewardship tasks automatically.

## Automations That Delight Donors

- **Welcome Journeys** - Tailored onboarding emails, volunteer invites, and impact stories based on donor intent.
- **Giving Day Boosters** - SMS nudges and social copy keep supporters active during critical fundraising windows.
- **Lapsed Donor Rescues** - Sentiment-aware outreach rekindles relationships before supporters drift away.

## Transparent Impact Reporting

1. **Story Vault** - AI compiles quotes, photos, and outcomes into ready-to-send updates.
2. **Board Briefings** - Monthly dashboards summarize donations, grants, and program reach.
3. **Grant Compliance** - Automations assemble documentation packages so funding stays secure.

> When donors feel seen, they stick around; AI simply makes that level of care sustainable.
