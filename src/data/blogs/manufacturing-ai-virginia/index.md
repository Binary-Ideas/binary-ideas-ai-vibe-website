## Plant Floors Need Faster Decisions

Production supervisors juggle safety logs, machine alerts, and vendor delays. We deploy edge-friendly AI that funnels all of that noise into actionable alerts, preventing downtime and boosting throughput. Because it’s open source, your internal engineers can modify agents without proprietary lock-in.

## Use Cases We See Weekly

- **Predictive Maintenance** – Sensor data routes through anomaly detection and schedules service before lines go idle.
- **Smart Replenishment** – Demand forecasts trigger purchase orders and notify suppliers through integrated portals.
- **Safety Copilot** – Computer vision flags PPE violations while agents automatically log incidents for OSHA reporting.

## Implementation With No Production Disruption

1. **Shadow Mode** – Agents observe and learn before taking action.
2. **Operator Training** – Short shift-change briefings teach teams how to interact with the system.
3. **Continuous Improvement** – Every alert is graded so the model keeps learning from your domain experts.

> Manufacturers across the Commonwealth are proving that open source AI is the fastest route to safer, smarter production lines.
