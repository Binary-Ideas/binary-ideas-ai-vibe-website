## Start With Policy, Not Just Prompts

Before a single agent is deployed, we map your regulatory landscape: HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI, or state procurement clauses. Every automation references that policy matrix, ensuring controls are baked into the workflow instead of bolted on later.

## Controls Baked Into the Stack

- **Role-Based Approvals** – High-risk actions require explicit signoff from authorized personnel.
- **Immutable Logs** – Every AI decision writes to append-only storage with timestamp and payload.
- **Data Boundary Enforcement** – Agents redact PHI, PII, and contract-sensitive data automatically.

## Keep Compliance Teams in the Loop

1. **Change Review Sprints** – Weekly checkpoints align legal, security, and operations.
2. **Simulation Environments** – Test decision paths with synthetic data before hitting production.
3. **Incident Playbooks** – Predefined escalation paths help your team respond quickly if something looks off.

> Compliance can be a competitive advantage—especially when your AI automations prove controls are in place from day one.
