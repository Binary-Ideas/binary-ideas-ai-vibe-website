## Extend Your Automation Stack

Binary Ideas builds modular agents that snap into the main open-source automation platform. Each agent handles a focused job—from qualifying leads to orchestrating back-office workflows—while sharing the same secure data layer.

### Agent Building Blocks

- **Event Triggers** – Listen to CRM updates, form submissions, or calendar bookings.
- **Decision Trees** – Model how your team responds and let the agent execute it.
- **Custom Skills** – Bolt on NLP, classification, or retrieval tools that fit your industry.

### How We Deploy

1. **Map the Workflow** – Document every touchpoint and desired outcome.
2. **Configure the Agent** – Choose triggers, actions, and safeties from our open library.
3. **Launch in Sprints** – Ship a pilot in days, then layer on new automations without downtime.

> Agents are version-controlled in Git, so you always know what logic is live and who approved it.

## Popular Automation Agents

- **Pipeline Qualifier** – Scores inbound leads, updates your CRM, and schedules follow ups automatically.
- **Billing Pursuit** – Chases overdue invoices and syncs notes back to accounting.
- **Onboarding Concierge** – Guides new clients through document collection and kickoff calls.

Need something specialized? Our team forks an existing agent or builds a new one on the same open foundation. Every enhancement is yours to reuse across departments.
