    description:
      "Most \"audits\" are 30-minute calls with a salesperson. We spend 5-10 hours interviewing your leadership AND frontline employees to understand reality—not just management's perception of it. The gap between these perspectives is where we find your biggest opportunities."

    title: "You See Everything Visually",
    description:
      "No 90-page reports you'll never read. You get visual diagrams (Ops Canvas, Opportunity Matrix, Roadmap) that you can share with your team and reference for years. One glance shows you exactly where problems exist and how to fix them."

    title: "ROI Backed by YOUR Data",
    description:
      "We don't use generic industry benchmarks. We calculate ROI using YOUR actual salaries, YOUR time spent on tasks, and YOUR revenue per employee. The numbers are real because they're based on your specific business."

    description:
      "We don't recommend expensive, complex projects upfront. We start with Quick Wins—low-effort, high-impact solutions that prove ROI in 3-6 months and build momentum for bigger projects later. You see results fast."

    title: "We Tell You What NOT to Do",
    description:
      "Part of the value is identifying expensive mistakes to avoid. We'll tell you which AI projects are overhyped, overpriced, or wrong for your business—saving you from wasting $50,000+ on solutions that won't deliver."
