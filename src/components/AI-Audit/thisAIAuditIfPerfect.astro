  "You're losing $10,000+ monthly to manual work but don't know which processes to automate first",
  "You have budget for AI implementation ($30K-$100K+) but need confidence before investing",
  'You\'ve been "researching AI solutions" for 3+ months and need someone to give you the answer',
  "Your team is drowning in repetitive tasks but you don't have data to justify hiring more people",
  "You need to present a business case to leadership/investors showing ROI of AI investment",
  "You want a roadmap showing exactly what to implement and when—not generic advice",
  "You're afraid of wasting money on wrong AI solutions and want expert validation first",
  "You need visual diagrams you can share with your team—not a 90-page report nobody will read"
