          One of our clients – a home repair guy from Gunston Heights – once told us,
          “If I don’t answer a lead in 5 minutes, they’re gone.” But he was always on a ladder,
          under a sink, or driving. He needed help. Not an assistant – but something smarter.
        </p>
        <p>
          We set him up with an AI Agent that picked up new leads, sent a follow-up text,
          and even scheduled calls. Now he gets more jobs without ever stopping work.

          So if you’re in Lorton, stuck doing it all yourself, it might be time to ask…
